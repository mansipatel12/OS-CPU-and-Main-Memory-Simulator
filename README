 Files included in my submission:
1) CS 4348 Mansi Patel Project 1 Summary: Word document that contains the summary of my project.
2) CPU.java: The CPU class that will be run for each sample test.
3) MainMemory.java: The MainMemory class that will be run from the CPU class using the Runtime exec function.
4) sample5.txt: Text file that will contain my personalized test for my project. 
5) README: Text file containing the file list, a description of each file, instructions on how to compile and
run my project, and a sample run.

To compile and run my project on the cs1 server:
Once logging into the cs1 server, please enter these commands in the terminal--
{cslinux1:~} javac CPU.java MainMemory.java
{cslinux1:~} java CPU sampleX.txt Y
X will be the sample number you would like to run, and Y will be your chosen timer interrupt value.
Please note that you cannot run the project without entering a file name and timer interrupt value; an error
message will be returned if you do not. 

Sample Run:
{cslinux1:~} javac CPU.java MainMemory.java
{cslinux1:~} java CPU sample1.txt 30
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ12345678910
