# OS-CPU-and-Main-Memory-Simulator
Project Purpose
This project was intended to simulate the relationship between the CPU and the main memory for instruction execution. The relationship between the CPU and the main memory was represented through processes and interprocess communication. The CPU and the main memory were implemented as separate processes that communicated with each other. The project enforced many concepts that are crucial to the functionality of an operating system. These concepts include interaction between the CPU and the main memory, the CPU instruction cycle, the use of registers and the stack, procedure calls, system calls, interrupt processing, memory protection, I/O processing, and virtualization. The project allowed me to receive a hands-on understanding of the relationships and functionalities of the CPU and the main memory within a computer system. 

My Experience
The project posed a challenge for me as I was new to processes and interprocess communication in Java. I was familiar with processes and pipes in C++ and C using Unix, so I was able to use a little bit of my previous knowledge when implementing the project. I first began the project by thoroughly reading the instructions, understanding the required structure for the implementation, and understanding the given examples in Java. I feel that the project allowed me to solidify my understanding of the functionalities of the CPU and main memory. It also gave me the experience of creating processes and managing interprocess communication in Java.
